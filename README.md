This is my mod.

It is completely useless and only adds 2 small things to the game. The mod exists mostly for fun, experimentation, and learning rather than for actual gameplay value.

## Content

The mod currently adds:

* 2 minor features
* no real practical purpose
* a bit of randomness

## Included files

All mod files are included in this repository. You are free to:

* explore the code
* modify the mod
* improve it
* turn it into something more useful

## License

This project is released under the MIT License.
You are allowed to use, modify, and redistribute the mod freely according to the terms of the license.

## Suggestions

If you would like me to add more features, feel free to suggest ideas.
I now have the skills to expand the mod, so if there is something you want to see added, let me know and I may implement it.

Ideas can be serious, experimental, or completely pointless.

## Final note

This project was created for fun and practice. Do not expect anything serious, but it may grow over time depending on feedback and ideas.
